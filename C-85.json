    "description": "On October 31, 2021, at 14:40, in the parking lot of the Sikupilli shopping center (Tallinn, Estonia), a security guard from FORUS Security (ID 36903255230) used pepper spray directly in my face without warning, despite the fact that I was already outside and posed no threat. The attack caused severe pain, temporary blindness, and I fell onto the pavement. I barely managed to get home. The medical diagnosis confirmed chemical eye damage (medical report No. 1003173085 from 31.10.2021, issued by AS Ida-Tallinna Keskhaigla). I filed a police report, but instead of opening a criminal case, the police attempted to accuse me of violating the mask mandate, ignoring the unlawful use of force against me.",
